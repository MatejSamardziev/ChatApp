A real-time chat application built with Java Spring Boot, 
utilizing WebSockets for seamless bi-directional communication and RabbitMQ for efficient message brokering. 
This project demonstrates a robust backend integration, 
with modern web technologies to deliver a dynamic and interactive chat experience.


This project is designed to be hosted on Azure, but due to a recent issue, it is currently not accessible online. I am actively working on resolving this issue and will update the repository once the site is fully operational again.


I have provided a Diagram to better visualize the basic functions of the web app and how it works

Note on Diagram:

The diagram provided is a high-level overview of the architecture and workflow of the web app. Due to the complexity of the application and the numerous functions involved, the diagram may not fully capture every detail or interaction. Certain components and processes are simplified or omitted for clarity. For a complete understanding of the application's functionality, please refer to the code.
